# AI Agent Service
#### This is project is a Python-based AI agent using the Gemini API to explore natural language processing, defining AI scope, and task automation.

## Motivation
AI is everywhere nowadays and I wanted to test to see how I can utilize AI to improve my own workflows. I also want to understand how one is supposed define the scope that an AI should have. I heard many things about implementing guardrails for an AI, and I wanted to know how that is done, how it could possibly be done better, or when and where mistakes might be made to cause some of these issues.

Next, I wanted to see how I can utilize an AI to automate some areas of minor debugging that I come across with projects. What functions can I define for an AI to utilize to better help it monitor and check my program?
